# Third-Year-Project

## Introduction

This github repository is home to a collaborated project by Darren-B312 (Darren Butler) and MrSkillage (Conor Rabbitte) for their third year project in the 'Professional Practice in Information Technology' module.
The program created is a multiplayer networked game of Tic-Tac-Toe, using the Java programming language. 

## System Requirements

1). Java 8 Language
2). Server (Cloud)
3). Client(s) (minimum of 2)

## Technology Used and Why

The technology used is the Java 8 programming language.  The main reasons for using this programming language is as follows:
- Good knowledge of Javas programming by both collaborators.
- Previous knowledge in Java networking from a past module (Operating Systems).
- Ease of access to vast set documentation online with the intent of learning new outcomes such as the graphics implementation in Java 8.

## Architecture of the Solution

## Design Methodology

The project is designed using a basic Java Project created in Eclipse Oxygen. Then the project is broken down into three seperated packages each with their own functionality. 
1). com.application
2). com.graphics
3). com.networking

## Features of the Implementation

## Limitations of Known Bugs

## Testing Plans

## Recommendations for Future Development
